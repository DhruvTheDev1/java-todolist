**TO DO LIST APPLICATION
**

This is a simple To-Do-List application where users can perform basic CRUD operations to manage tasks. The application currently uses in-memory storage for simplicity.

Features
- Create: Users can add new tasks with an ID, name and description.
- Read: Users can view a specific task by ID or all tasks.
- Update: Users can update an existing task.
- Delete: Users can remove tasks individually or clear the entire task list
  
Further Work:
- More validation to ensure correct task data.
- Incrementing ID automatically hence users do not need to enter an ID every time.

This project is planned to be expanded into a Spring Boot application with a database backend for persistent storage hence why it is kept simple and straightforward.
- Database Integration: Stores tasks in a relational database such as MySQL.
- SpringBoot: Application converted to a web-based REST API.
